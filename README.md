# tools
An array of tools myself and peers designed for various IT tasks, primarily focused on Cyber Security.
The *-for-ethical-hacking folders were forked from the R3DHULK repositories. At the time of this commit, they are mostly functioning well at a high level, so please ensure to give R3DHULK the deserved respect.
